Add or modify the Reply-to and Bcc addresses on WooCommerce emails.

== Description ==

This plugin can be used to globally modify the Reply-to and/or Bcc addresses used by WooCommerce for all its emails.
In the WooCommerce settings, go to the "Emails" tab, and in the bottom of the page you will find two fields for the
Reply-to address, and one field for the Bcc address. Only if you configure these addresses, these will overwrite any
WooCommerce standard address. You can configure only the Reply-to or only the Bcc, but the Reply-to needs both it's
fields to be configured to work.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add more than one email address into each field? =

No, only one address will work.

= Can I add BCC or Reply-to only to specific WooCommerce email? =

No, these two fields will be used for all WooCommerce emails, but if there are requests I can plan to support also specific emails.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is the WooCommerce administration panel of the emails, with the new fields in the bottom.
