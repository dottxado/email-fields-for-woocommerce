# Email Fields For WooCommerce

Add or modify the Reply-to and Bcc addresses on WooCommerce emails.

## Use it

Install it directly from the [WordPress plugin repository](https://it.wordpress.org/plugins/email-fields-for-woocommerce/).

## Description

This plugin can be used to globally modify the Reply-to and/or Bcc addresses used by WooCommerce for all its emails.

## Configuration

In the WooCommerce settings, go to the "Emails" tab, and in the bottom of the page you will find two fields for the
Reply-to address, and one field for the Bcc address. Only if you configure these addresses, these will overwrite any
WooCommerce standard address. You can configure only the Reply-to or only the Bcc, but the Reply-to needs both it's
fields to be configured to work.
